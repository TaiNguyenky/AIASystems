2.	The problem that product is solving
The idea of artificial intelligence (AI) is not new one. AI system is an expert system with machine learning application which can do one very narrow thing in a specific domain.
But now, things have changed. The AI system can ingest a wide range of data and provide smart decision on it. There are exciting times in technology, but they are also exciting times in business. Today is a great time for me to attend Toowoomba start up group meeting, and I would like to talk on the topic: AI system for agriculture based on data analysis and decision support system. 
The challenge in agriculture is that there are a lot of decisions must be made based on collecting a wide range of information. Therefore, the data which are collected and processed in real time can help farmers to make the best decisions with regard to planting, irrigating, fertilizing and harvesting crops.


To optimal crops grow, farmers need to understand and consider how to grow the crops in a particular area, seedâ€™s resistance to weather and local diseases, and the environmental impact of planting that seed. After planning, famers need to make the decisions for irrigation, fertilizing, spraying and maintaining the crops which are time-sensitive and heavily influenced by the weather. 

AI system can assist farmers to decide which, where and when crops to plant, to determine the locations, methods, and tools to collect and analysis data in real time, and then directly perform the relevant analysis and feed the results to a large database stored in the cloud. Wireless and fix sensors placed on the fields are used to measure temperature, humidity of the soil and air, and plant growth. In addition, video and pictures of fields are taken using satellite imagery and robotic drones. These collecting data are used to build AI system that can provide the vehicle for a significantly large step-up in agriculture application. AI systems are being developed based on a sensing system and empirical crop models to determine current and predict future soil-water and nitrogen parameters, and fruit load of plants based on daily weather data and visual plant response.
